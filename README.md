Aadhaar Fraud Detection using AI & OCR

This project verifies the authenticity of Aadhaar cards using:

✔ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
✔ Image Preprocessing (OpenCV)
✔ Optical Character Recognition (Tesseract)
✔ Streamlit User Interface

It detects whether an Aadhaar card is Genuine or Tampered and extracts key fields such as:

Name

Date of Birth

Aadhaar Number

🚀 How to Run the Project

1️⃣ Install Dependencies 

pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Install Tesseract OCR

Download from → https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki

Update this line in app.py with your Tesseract installation path:

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"

3️⃣ Run Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py
